OchemPath â€” Learn organic chemistry with interactive practice quizzes and course-like content.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project (the app uses the App Router) and provides a small learning platform with:

- Course listing pages
- Per-course quiz pages
- Dashboard for creating quizzes and viewing submissions

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

You can start editing the app by modifying files under `src/app/`. The page auto-updates as you edit.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a Google Font.
